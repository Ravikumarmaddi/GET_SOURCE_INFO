HOW TO USE MY TOOLS PROJECT
==================================

1. Create a filter 'JAVA' in your gmail account.
	Matches: java
	Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "JAVA"
   Note: this is very basic filter, you can do more conditions based on your need. But the goal is what ever you want to send those should come to this folder automatically.

2. create folders:
     D:/yourname/INPUT
	 D:/yourname/DO/INPUT
	 D:/yourname/DO/COUNT
	 D:/yourname/DO/LAST
	 D:/yourname/DO/PROCESSED
	 D:/yourname/DO/PROCESSING
	 D:/yourname/DO/TOTAL
3. COPY YOUR COVER LETTER AND PROFILE TO
	D:/yourname/

4. Import MYTOOLS application to your eclipse workspace.

5. CHANGE AND CHECK THE ALL THE PATHS USED IN MYTOOLS ARE CORRECT OR NOT.
